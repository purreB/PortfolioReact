            As previously mentioned I am learning FrontEnd-Development at JENSEN
            Yh. While the title of the education is FrontEnd we have also
            learned a good amount of backend skills such as SQL, APIs,
            express.js, node.js, document databases. I am also learning
            a lot of cyber, network and application security together with
